# Ignore files when rendering/building site (to hide from Nav tree and sitemap)
# Add files here that you "include" in other files using the 'readfile' shortcode
# Examples:
# Based on root path: {{% readfile file="docs/serving/README.md" markdown="true" %}}
# Using relative path: {{% readfile file="README.md" relatative="true" markdown="true" %}}
#
# All README.md files are ignored because they are "included" into _index.md files
# and we want the build to avoid blank nav entries and extra/duplicate sitemap entries.
# (the README.md files are kept for GitHub repo users so a landing pages appears)
